            <h2>A practical guide to help you Astral Project within a few hours</h2>

            <p>
               <br><br>
               You are going to need the following:<br><br>

               1. Quite, dark and cool area.<br>
               2. An optional blanket.<br>
               3. Your body, possibly on empty stomach. (do not eat two hours before you lie down to astral project, no drugs, no alcohol, no sex or masturbation, they lower your vital energy).<br><br>


               How to astral project?<br>
               Is it hard?<br>
               Does it require a lot of practice?<br>
               Will it take long?<br>
               How will I know I am Astral Projecting?<br><br>


               After all my experiences and research, I can conclude that it is possible to Astral Project in a very small time with little but properly guided steps. It does not require a lot of practice and once you are there, you will know.<br>
               I will share my technique with you and you will need to memorize it in order to be able to understand and control the process when you attempt astral projection.<br><br>


               So letâ€™s begin.<br><br>


               The whole process is divided into 3 major steps:<br>

               1. Deep relaxation (Sleep Paralysis)<br>
               2. Mindful Meditation<br>
               3. Astral Projection<br><br>


               Step #1: Deep Relaxation<br><br>


               The first step of the process is to put your body into a deeply relaxed state. In a deeply relaxed state, your body is sound asleep, it is not aware of it's physical presence. However, your mind is fully awake and aware of the fact that your body is asleep. This stage is closely related to the term Sleep Paralysis. Sleep paralysis is a state which you experience when your body is asleep and suddenly you wake up and come to know that you are paralyzed, that you cannot feel or move your body. People find this state scary but really it is nothing to be afraid of. In fact it is quiet cool.<br><br>

               So, the basic trick here is to slip into a deeply relaxed state and to fool your mind into thinking that your body is asleep by laying as still as you can for as long as you can.<br>
               So, How do we feel deeply relaxed? Let's see.<br><br>

               1. Lay down on a comfortable bed with your back straight and close your eyes.<br><br>

               2. You might want to cover yourself with a blanket because once you start relaxing, your body temperature will fall down and you will feel cold.<br><br>

               3. Tilt your neck slightly to either side if you feel more comfortable.<br><br>

               4. Put your hands beside your stomach, with your palms facing down on the bed.<br><br>

               5. Stretch your legs straight and slightly widened, foot tilted on sides so that you feel comfortable and do not feel the need to move for long time.<br><br>

               6. Make any adjustments right now before moving further. Remember, you are going to be in this very position for the next one to two hours. So make sure you are very comfortable.<br><br>

               7. Now laying completely still, start focusing on your body parts one by one and send them a signal to just relax and lay on the bed. Start with your forehead, loosen the tensed muscles, move to your eyes, free any tension from the muscles and let your eyes be lightly closed. Move to your jaw. Let your upper jaw and lower jaw be apart and relaxed. Don't clench your teeth. Let your tongue rest very comfortably in your mouth. Move to your neck, loosen and stress and let your head lay in its place without any stress on neck. Move to your shoulders and release any stress. Move to your arms and hands. Let them lay on the bed very comfortably, loosen your muscles as much as you can. Move to your upper and lower back, let it completely relax. Stress free. Just laying like a paperweight on the comfortable bed. Relax your abdomen, let it rise and fall freely, do not pull in or push out. Move down to your hips, let them relax. Move to your thigh muscles and loosen them up. Move to your calf muscles and release any tension from the muscles. Finally, move to your feet and just let them lay on the bed, very relaxed and stress free.<br><br>

               8. Once again go through your whole body from top to bottom and find any stress and release it. Just loosen up. Just lay on the bed, without any tension in any part of your body.<br><br>

               9. Now, laying very still on your back, breathe with half of your normal breathing speed. When you are asleep your body breaths with just half the speed of normal breathing. So you only need half the speed of your normal breathing. And remember to not keep changing your breathing speed. Your body will actually spot it and will stay awake.<br><br>

               10. Remain in this state for some time. Do not move your body. While you try to trick your body to sleep you will have the following sensations: itchy body, your body telling you that you are not comfortable and you need to move. This is just the beginning. When you get very close to sleep paralysis, you will face the strongest hurdle. Your body will tell you that it's not working and you have to give up, it's just a waste of time. Trust me its very very very very very hard to ignore. But you must always remember that once you get this feeling it means that you are about to enter the sleep paralysis. Just remember one thing, once you get the feeling of giving up, you have reached around 90% for the sleeping paralysis. Do not give up. These are just some signals being sent by your brain to your body to check if it is asleep. If you do not react to these sensations, your brain will start to think that your body is asleep and it will free your body from consciousness. Only then can your consciousness move out of your body to other higher dimensions.<br><br>

               11. As your body enters deep relaxation state, you might experience chilling waves running through your body parts. You might also experience the flow of blood through your body. It is a good sign. It means that your body is relaxed. Do not look for these signs, they will present themselves when your body is relaxed enough. Just lay as still as you can for as long as you can. Nothing else.<br><br>

               12. Finally, when your body is deeply relaxed, your whole body might feel numb. You might feel your body parts have become so heavy that you cannot move them. In reality however, they have not became heavy, it's just that your conscious mind is no longer aware of their existence. Don't be scared by it. It is absolutely normal. In fact it is what happens when anybody falls asleep. It is called Sleep paralysis.<br><br>

               This step might take 20-30 minutes, so do not hurry. You can do it slowly and easily. This ends the first step. Now, lets move to the second step.<br><br><br><br>




               Step #2: Mindful Meditation<br><br>

               The second step of the process is Mindful Meditation. In this step, you are going to Meditate for 45 to 60 minutes. If you are a beginner, you might want to meditate for longer, say 90 minutes.<br>
               So, How do we meditate? Let's see.<br><br>

               1. In the deeply relaxed state, start observing your normal breathing.<br><br>

               2. Just observe your breath in between the nostrils, the fresh, cool air going in and cleansing your lungs and warm air leaving out. Just be aware of your breathing.<br><br>

               3. Various thoughts will come to your mind. Do not concentrate on them. Let them come and let them go. Go back to observing your breathing. Start counting your breaths. Yes, thatâ€™s all. But not like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.... no, count it like this, Breath in (1), Breath out (1), Breath in (2) , Breath out (2)â€¦.<br><br>

               4. Do not concentrate, just observe it. Be with it. Let it naturally happen. Do not inhale or exhale forcefully. Just observe it. Just be with it.<br><br><br>


               This step might take 40-60 minutes, so do not hurry. You can do it slowly and easily. This ends the second step. Now, lets move to the last step.<br><br><br><br>




               Step #3: Astral Projection<br>
               THIS STEP WILL BE UPDATED SOON.<br><br><br>


               You are now done. You can now try to astral project and it will work totally for sure. Remember to always trust yourself. Take care and good luck. Hope you be well. Have a safe trip.<br><br><br>



               Summary:<br><br>

               Lay on your back and hands besides your stomach, close your eyes and focus on counting your breaths, breath with half of your normal speed of breathing, relax, calm your eyebrows, remove all ideas from your head and self-trust. Remember you need to learn the exit techniques. They are easy to learn but you need to find the one which suits you very well and use it.<br><br><br>



               CAUTION!<br>
               Biggest mistake you could do is to try it when you are going to sleep. You are already tired. You won't be able to do it if you have no energy. Do it after you wake up or when you feel that you have full energy.<br><br><br>

               Feel free to ask any question. I will keep on updating this guide.
